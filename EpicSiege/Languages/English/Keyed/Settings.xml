	<ESM_IncidentDefCategoryOverride>
[Edit IncidentDef category and BaseChance]
To apply these changes, you must reload the game or start a new game after editing on this screen.

What is a category?: ThreatBig, ThreatSmall, Misc, etc. Events are selected from within their category.

Meaning:
ThreatBig: Large-scale threats (major raids, insect infestations, and many modded threats. These compete heavily and are selected less frequently due to the event cycle.)
ThreatSmall: Small-scale threats (in vanilla mostly manhunter animals, so there is less competition. However, they occur less often due to the cycle.)
Misc: Other events (psychic drones, heat waves, etc. These compete more but are selected more frequently in the cycle.)

If you want this event to occur occasionally, set it to Misc with a BaseChance of around 3.
If you want it to occur only rarely, set it to ThreatBig with a BaseChance of around 4.

Since this depends on your mod environment, if the event is not occurring often enough, try increasing the BaseChance.

To see how BaseChance affects the actual selection probability, RimWorld provides an official debug option that allows you to sample incident chances in your current environment.

■ How to check actual fire chance (official debug feature)
1. Load a save that has progressed to some extent
2. Enable Development Mode
3. Open debug action menu
4. Select "Output" → "Incident chances sampled"

Look for "ESEpicSiegeIncident" in the DefName column.
The "fire chance" value in that row is the sampled probability.

■ How to check whether the incident can currently fire
You can also check this in "Incident chances" in the debug menu.

If "can fire" is checked in the row for "ESEpicSiegeIncident",
then the incident can currently occur under the present conditions.

	<ESM_CustomRaidPhases>
[Custom raid behavior]

Note:
• Raid timing is calculated by dividing 21,600 ticks by the number of remaining enemy bases.
• Raid phases are displayed as Phase 1–3, but due to TPS dependency, they may not always occur in exact order.
• If the number of bases belonging to the same faction exceeds the limit (3), for example by changing the Incident category,
raid timing will be randomized within 21,600 ticks.
• Depending on modded races, breaching raids may not be available.
For this reason, there is an option to make all raids occur immediately.
