ver1.0.3
[Bug Fix]
A bug inherited from the original EpicSiege has been identified and fixed.
Specifically, when the incident fires, the IncidentWorker_SetUpSiegeCamp.TryExecuteWorker method (defined in the worker class associated with the IncidentDef) was being called with parms.forced = true.

As a result, when the storyteller later calls Notify_IncidentFired, the storyteller does not properly record the incident’s last fire time. This causes an issue where, even if <minRefireDays>30</minRefireDays> is defined in the IncidentDef, the incident may occur again without waiting the intended 30 days.

Since the original author is no longer available, the original intention behind setting parms.forced = true is unknown. However, this behavior negatively affects the intended functionality (preventing EpicSiege incidents from occurring again within 30 days), and there is no functional requirement for EpicSiege to run with forced = true. Therefore, this has been removed.

[New Feature]

Added a feature that allows IncidentDef settings to be modified in-game.

ver1.0.2
[Bug Fixes]

Fixed an issue where the cache was not properly cleared when the enemy site was not destroyed within the time limit.

Fixed an issue where, if one enemy site was destroyed but the remaining sites were not cleared in time, a raid would still occur and peace negotiations or enemy leader execution would be triggered incorrectly.

[New Feature]

Some race/faction mods do not define certain raid types (for example, siege raids).
To support these mods, you can now customize raid phases in the mod settings, including setting all phases to immediate raids only.

[Behavior / Mechanics]

If you eliminate all enemies at an enemy site but remain there without leaving, the site will not be destroyed. The raid will instead trigger when you leave the site.

This is because the system treats it as a timeout condition.

There may be ways to change this, but it is currently treated as intended behavior.

This behavior is inherited from the original EpicSiege.

If you reduce the number of enemy sites to two, and another EpicSiege incident occurs, the total number of sites may increase (for example, to five).

After destroying three of them, you may receive a letter stating that only one site remains.

Destroying one more site will also destroy the final remaining site automatically (this is normal behavior).
This occurs because additional sites were added during the event chain.

If a raid is triggered before leaving your current location via a gravship, the raid will not occur because the player’s location has changed.

[About Spawn Probability]

If the incident occurs too rarely, you can increase its probability by editing:
Incident_EpicSiege.xml

Setting:

baseChance = 5


will result in approximately a 19% chance in a vanilla environment.

Alternatively, you can make it much more common by setting:

category = Misc
baseChance = 2


This is because the ThreatBig category is heavily contested by other faction mods.

Category examples:

ThreatBig ← Raids, Sieges, Clusters

ThreatSmall ← Small combat events

Misc ← Neutral / miscellaneous events
